This project is a minimalist implementation of the classic game Snake, written in just 8 lines of JavaScript code / HTML. The challenge was to create a functional game with as few lines of code as possible. 
The rules were that each time a semi-colon was used, a new line had to be started. Other than that, any "one liner" technique could be used. For example `0| let x=0, y=1;` is permitted, but not `0| func_1(); func_2();`

## How to Play
1. Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the snake.
2. Eat the fruit to grow longer.
